== Introduction

SmartSplit is a desktop app for managing shared expenses between contacts. More importantly, SmartSplit is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SmartSplit can get your shared expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `smartsplit.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SmartSplit app.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`addPerson`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com : adds a contact named `John Doe` to SmartSplit.
* **`deletePerson`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current person list
* **`addTransaction`**`payer/John Doe a/100.00 d/Taxi ride to NUS payee/Alex Yeoh payee/Bernice Yu` : adds a transaction payed by John Doe costing $100.00 for a taxi ride split with Alex Yeoh and Bernice Yu.
* **`deleteTransaction`**`2` : deletes the 2nd transaction shown in the current transaction list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Adding a transaction: `addTransaction` `[Since v1.2]` `[Updated for v1.5rc]`

Format with 1 Payee: `addTransaction type/TRANSACTION TYPE payer/PAYER NAME a/AMOUNT d/DESCRIPTION payee/PAYEE NAME m/SPLIT METHOD [units/LIST OF UNITS] [percentages/LIST OF PERCENTAGES]` +
Format with more than 1 Payee: `addTransaction type/TRANSACTION TYPE payer/PAYER NAME a/AMOUNT d/DESCRIPTION payee/PAYEE NAME payee/PAYEE NAME m/SPLIT METHOD [units/LIST OF UNITS] [percentages/LIST OF PERCENTAGES]`

****
* The options for transaction type are: *payment* and *paydebt*.
** *payment* is for recording a transaction that was paid by a person on behalf of himself/herself and other persons.
** *paydebt* is for recording a transaction that reduces an existing debt owed to another person. *Only 1 payee is allowed.*
* The options for split method are: *evenly*, *units*, and *percentage*. If no method is specified, the transaction will default to split evenly.
** Only specify a split method if the transaction type is *payment*.
** If *units* is selected as the split method, a list of integers representing the units must be entered as a comma-separated list. The first integer is the number of units
associated with the payer. Each subsequent integer is associated with each payee in the order in which they are specified in the command. The amount that each involved
person owes is calculated by the following: +
Amount Owed = Transaction Amount * (Units for the Person / Total Number of Units)
** If *percentage* is selected as the split method, a list of integers representing the percentages must be entered as a comma-separated list. The first integer is the percentage
associated with the payer. Each subsequent integer is associated with each payee in the order in which they are specified in the command. *The percentages must add up to 100*.
The amount that each involved person owes is calculated by the following: +
Amount Owed = Transaction Amount * (Percentage for the Person / 100)
* The names for the payer and payee(s) used in the transaction must be in the SmartSplit addressbook.
* At least one payee is required. There is no limit to how many unique payees that may be added as long as they exist in the SmartSplit addressbook.
* A payee cannot be the payer.
* The amount must be a positive number with exactly two decimals.
* The description must not be empty.
****
Examples:

1. `addTransaction type/payment payer/John Doe a/1000.00 d/Fancy dinner payee/Tom Riddle`
* Adds a transaction where John Doe paid $1000.00. This is split evenly by default with Tom Riddle.
Thus, John Doe's balance will increase by 500.00 since he can expect to get much back from Tom Riddle.
Tom Riddle's balance will decrease by 500.00 (reflected as -500.00) since that is the amount he owes.

2. `addTransaction type/payment payer/Betsy Crowe a/30.00 d/Team T-shirts payee/John Doe payee/Bernice Yu m/units units/1, 2, 3`
* Adds a transaction where Betsy Crowe paid $30.00 for team t-shirts. The split method is by units with a split of
"1, 2, 3". The total number of units is 6. Thus, Betsy Crowe is responsible for 30.00 * (1/6) = 5.00. Similarly, John Doe
is responsible for 10.00 and Bernice Yu is responsible for 15.00. Since Betsy Crowe paid for the transaction, her
balance will increase by 25.00 since that is the sum of what she is owed. John Doe's balance will decrease by 10.00 (reflected as -10.00)
and Bernice Yu's balance will decrease by 15.00 (reflected as -15.00).

3. `addTransaction type/payment payer/Steven Jia a/50.00 d/Taxi ride payee/Paul Mignot payee/Kok Cong Ong m/percentage percentage/50, 10, 10`
* The *addTransaction* command fails because the sum of the percentages is not 100.

4. `addTransaction type/payment payer/Steven Jia a/50.00 d/Taxi ride payee/Paul Mignot payee/Kok Cong Ong m/percentage percentage/38, 28, 34`
* Adds a transaction where Steven Jia paid $50.00 for a shared taxi ride. The split method is by percentage with a split of
"38, 28, 34". Thus, Steven Jia is responsible for 50.00 * (38/100) = 19.00. Similarly, Paul Mignot
is responsible for 14.00 and Kok Cong Ong is responsible for 17.00. Since Steven Jia paid for the transaction, his
balance will increase by 31.00 since that is the sum of what he is owed. Paul Mignot's balance will decrease by 14.00 (reflected as -14.00)
and Kok Cong Ong's balance will decrease by 17.00 (reflected as -17.00).

5. `addTransaction type/paydebt payer/Tom Riddle a/500.00 d/Pay John for last night's dinner payee/John Doe
* Adds a transaction where Tom Riddle paid John Doe $500.00. Tom Riddle's balance increases by 500.00 since
he no longer owes that amount. John Doe's balance decreases by 500.00 since he is no longer owed that amount.

6. `addTransaction type/paydebt payer/Bernice Yu a/15.00 d/Pay Betsy for last night's dinner payee/Betsy Crowe payee/John Doe
* The *addTransaction* command fails because the there is more than 1 payee when the transaction type is *paydebt*.

Deletes the specified transaction from SmartSplit. +
Format: `deleteTransaction INDEX`

=== Locating transactions by name: `findTransaction` `[Coming in v2.0]`

Format: `findTransaction KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `monthly rent` will match `Monthly Rent`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Rent Monthly` will match `Monthly Rent`
* All fields are searched.
* Only full words or numbers will be matched e.g. `Month` will not match `Monthly`
* Transactions matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
e.g. `Monthly` will return transactions with descriptions such as `Monthly Rent`, `Monthly Netflix Subscription`
