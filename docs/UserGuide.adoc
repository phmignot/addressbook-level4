== Introduction

SmartSplit is a desktop app for managing share expenses between your contacts*. More importantly, SmartSplit is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SmartSplit can get your shared expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
